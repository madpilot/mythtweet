An uber simple bot that takes a twitter feed, and pushes tweets to the mythtvosd program. I'm currently using it to tweet comments from @back_of_the_new during the world cup.

Requirements
------------

1. feedzirra
2. MythTV

Usage:
------

1. Find the user you want to follow, and click on there RSS feed. You need the user_id
2. Edit mythtwitter.rb and change the user_id
3. Run it

Improvements
------------

I wrote this in 5 minutes, so it's really basic. Daemonisation would be nice I guess. So would multiple accounts.
